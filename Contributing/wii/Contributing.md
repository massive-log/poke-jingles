Want to add Wii jingles to this repo, but don't know how? It's really simple!

Fork the repository and we'll get started.

First, get your Wii rom files ready. This means they'll need to be in the .rvz file format. If you have them in some other format, please convert them.

Then, you're going to need to download the tools `dolphin-tool`, `szs` from szs.wiimm.de and `vgmstream`.
Once you have these installed, move all your ROMs into one folder. For ease of use, I have created a bash script to easily rip your .wavs! (`extract_jingle.sh` in the Contributing/wii directory of the repository.)

Once you've ripped your jingles from your ROMs, please rename them in a reasonable manner. For example,
`Punch-Out!!.wav` becomes `punch-out.wav`

Then, move your jingles into `jingles/wii`, and edit the `index.json` in the root of the repository accordingly, adding a new entry in the json with this format:

```
    { "game": "*game name as it appears in cocoon*", "file": "jingles/wii/*your jingle here*.wav"},
```

For example,

```
    {"game": "Super Mario Galaxy", "file": "jingles/wii/super-mario-galaxy.wav"},
```

It would be very much appreciated if you placed these in alphabetical order.

Once that's done, open a pull request, and you're done!

Don't know how to make a pull request, but still want to add jingles you've ripped? Contact me on Discord at `red6785`! I'll probably accept!
